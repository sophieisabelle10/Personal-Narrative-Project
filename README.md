# Unit 5 - Personal Narrative / Interest Animation

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create an animation using The Theater and Scene API that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests. In this animation, you will incorporate data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.
## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:
- **Write Scene subclasses** – Create two Scene subclasses: either two core parts of your personal life, or two components of a personal interest. Each class must contain a constructor and private instance variable with data related to the scene
- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
Implement algorithms – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and logic that operate on the data in your 2D arrays.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Image Filters** – Utilize the image filters created in this unit (and possible new filters) that show a personal flare to the images used in your animation.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Story Description

My project represents different types of dances  and how they look when displayed on a filter. I chose difference styles of dance because dance  is something that I really enjoy so I wanted to show people some beautiful pictures I was able to find and display them under code that I was able to learn about.

## Image Filter Analysis

For the colorize Filter, the filter takes the image and each time applies 255 red, and 0 green and blue, then that pattern continues on to change by it being 0 red, 255 green, and 0 blue, and so on. This allows the image to display only very bright shades of green red and blue. 

For the negative filter, it applys each of the red green and blue colors, and it subtracts 255 to the current amount. This then allows the images to turn into a various shades of blue grey white and black which is considered the negative colored images.
